\section{The Monte Carlo method}%{{{1

\subsection{Introduction}%{{{2
Monte Carlo (MC) methods includes a wide range of computational methods for solving integrals. 
The main idea is to sample the integrand $f(\vec r)$ in random points $\{\vec r_i\}$, 
and finding an approximate solution to the integral by doing statistical analysis on the sampling data. 
The statistical error will give us an immediate idea of the precicion of the result.
%Statistical measures will give us an idea of the quality of the results

In general, any integral can be written on the form
\begin{align}
\int_{\mathcal D} f(\vec r) d\vec r = 
\int_{\mathcal D} P(\vec r) g(\vec r) d\vec r,
\end{align} 
where $P(\vec r)$ is a probability distribution. The integral can now be approximated by the sum 
\begin{align}
	\int_{\mathcal D} f(\vec r) d\vec r 
\approx \frac1N\sum_{i=1}^Ng(\vec r_i),
\end{align} 
where $\{\vec{r_i}\}$ is a set of random numbers drawn from the statistical distribution $P(\vec r)$.

The simplest example, possible whenever the region of the of the integral is finite,
is when $P$ is a uniform distribution bounded by the integration limits. Then
$P(\vec r)$ is a constant and $g(\vec r)=f(\ts r)$. However, for many integrals this method 
will converge slowly and will require a very large number of samples to
give accurate results. By choosing a smart $P(\vec r)$ that is large in the regions of interest, 
%for example where $g(\ts r)$ is large or changing rapidly,  
more samples will be drawn from the important regions, often leading to a more rapid convergence.  
%}}}2

\subsection{Markov Chain Monte Carlo}%{{{2

Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) provides us with a method for drawing the correct samples from $P$. 
Instead of drawing uncorrelated random samples we use a markow chain to generate a sequence $\{\vec r_n\}$ of vectors.
A Markov chain is caracterized by a transition kernel $q(\vec x|\vec y)$ which is a probabitity density distribution 
of the variable $\vec y$, and which tells us the probability of a transition from $\vec x$ to $\vec y$.
For each $\vec r_n$, we draw a new $\vec r_{n+1}$ from the distribution $q(\vec r_n,\vec y)$. The distribution 
of the vectors in the set 
$\{\vec r_n\}$ will converge towards the distribution $P$ if the following 
conditions are fulfilled (reference):
\begin{itemize}
\item
	$P$ is an invariant of the kernel $q(\vec x|\vec y)$ in the sense that 
	\begin{align}
	\int_{\mathcal D} d\vec r_A\, P(\vec r_A) q(\vec r_A | \vec r_B) = P(\vec r_B) \label{eq221},
	\end{align}
\item
	The chain is ergodetic, which means that any point $\vec r_n$ is axessible in a finite number transitions from any starting point $\vec r_0$. 
	\begin{align}
		0>&q(r_0|r_1)q(r_1|r_2)\dots q(r_{n-1}|r_n),\notag\\
		&\{r_0,r_1,\dots,r_n\}\in\mathcal D 
	\end{align}
	for all $r_0,r_n$. 	
	(more?reference!)
%all $\vec r$ in $\mathcal D$% must be axessible to a random walker
%starting in any point $\vec r_0$ in $\mathcal D$ during a finite number of transitions. 
\end{itemize}

%More sophisticated methods exist, like the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm, where the drawing process is biased.
%To compensate for the biased 
%This method has the drawback that the samples are correlated which makes the analysis of the results somewhat more demanding. But the method also has
%some important advantages. One of them, as we will see later, is that the probabilityfunction $P$ does not need to be normalised. 
%This property comes very handy when dealing with many-particle wavefunctions in quantum mechanics.
%
%$P$ is sampled by generating a random new $\vec r_i$. The new position is then accepted by a probability 
%
%Both statements are actually quite intuitive, and i will now explain why(rewrite sentence):
It is costumary to make the analogy to a set of $\lambda$ biased random walkers, where
the density of walkers $P_w$ is (close to) stationary and proportional to $P$.
This analogy is reasonable as long as the sequence $\{\vec r_n\}$ can be split into $\lambda$ 
subsequences $\{\vec r_n^\lambda\}$ which are uncorrelated. Then one can equally well interpret the samples as $N$ samples
from one markov chain, as $N/\lambda$ samples from $\lambda$ markov chains.

For $P_w$ to be stationary (), the population of walkers in any point $\vec r_A$ must be () constant,
\begin{align}
	\sum_n P_w(\vec r_A) q(\vec r_A|\vec r_n)  \approx	\sum_n P_w(\vec r_n) q(\vec r_n|\vec r_A) \label{eq222}
\end{align} 
This equation resembles('') (\ref{eq221}) since both equaions states that the density is stationary.
%Of course, in a computer simulation the number of walkers is finite, and this equation can only be seen as an approximation.
%The markov chain must also be ergodetic. 
%One are free to choose any equation for the trajectories of the random walkers (any transition kernel) as long as (\ref{eq222})
The condition of detailed balance
\begin{align}
    P_w(\vec r_A) q(\vec r_A|\vec r_B)  =  P_w(\vec r_B) q(\vec r_B|\vec r_A).\label{detbal}
\end{align}
assures that (\ref{eq222}) is fulfilled. 
%This equation is the basis for finding the transition kernels that is used in the metropolis-Hastings algorithm.
As long as the markow chain is ergodetic the walkers will have axcess to all regions of the integration domain.
% ad the entire integration domain will be sampled.
%If not (ergodetic in regions: can be tackled ? )
%}}}2

\subsection{Metropolis-Hasting algorithm}%{{{2
We will now outline a general algorithm for the movement of the random walkers that fullfills (\ref{detbal}).
We introduce new scalar field to our equation $\gamma(\vec r_A,\vec r_B)$, which is a measure of the 
probability of accepting a move from $\vec r_A$ to $\vec r_B$.
We split our transition kernel in two parts
\begin{align}
	q(\vec r_A|\vec r_b) 
		\to 
	\gamma(\vec r_A|\vec r_b)
	g(\vec r_A|\vec r_b).
\end{align} 
i will refer to $g(r_A|r_B)$ as the suggestion density, and $\gamma(\vec r_A|\gamma \vec r_B)$ as the acceptance probability. We set
\begin{align}
&\gamma(\vec r_B|\vec r_A)=1 \text{ when }\notag\\
%\begin{align}
    &P_w(\vec r_A) g(\vec r_A|\vec r_B)  >  P_w(\vec r_B) g(\vec r_B|\vec r_A).
\end{align}
Then, by inserting this equations into (\ref{detbal}), we get
\begin{align} 
	\gamma(\vec r_A|\vec r_B)=max\left(
	\frac
	{P_w(\vec r_B) g(\vec r_B|\vec r_A)}
    {P_w(\vec r_A) g(\vec r_A|\vec r_B)}\, 
	,\, 1 \right) \label{gamma}
\end{align}
By making this choice for $\gamma$, (\ref{detbal}) will be fulfilled and the sequence of $\{r_i\}$ will sample 
$P$. 
%This rule preserves the relative provability of the transitions between $r_A$ and $r_B$, and preserves the 
%density of walkers in each point.  
Note that only the relative ratio between the left and the right hand side of (eq) are 
of interest to us. Therefore, $P$ does not have to be normalized. 
These equations are implemented in the well known Metropolis-Hastings algorithm as follows:
%
%\begin{algorithm}[h]
\begin{algorithmic}
\LOOP{}
\STATE{$\vec r_B\gets$ random from distribution $g(\vec r_T|\vec r_B)$.}
\STATE{$\mathcal X\gets$ random uniform. ($\mathcal X\in[0,1]$)}%??(0,1)}
\STATE{Calculate $\gamma (\vec r_n|\vec r_T))$.}

\ELSE

\ENDIF{}
\STATE{$n\gets n+1$}
\ENDLOOP{}
\end{algorithmic}
%\label{alg1}

\subsection{Choice of transition kernel} %{{{2

The transition kernel can be written as
\begin{align}
	q(\vec r_n|\vec r_{n+1}) = \gamma(\vec r_n|\vec r_{n+1}) g(\vec r_n|\vec r_{n+1}), 
\end{align}
where $\gamma(\vec r_{n}|\vec r_{n+1})$ is given by eq. (\ref{gamma}). 
The set $\{r_n\}$ will converge tovards the same distribution $P_w$ regardless of which $g(\vec r_n|\vec r_{n+1})$ we use. 
(As long as the markov chain defined by $g(\vec r_n|\vec r_{n+1})$ and $\gamma(\vec r_n|\vec r_{n+1})$ is ergodetic.)
However, the rate of convergence can .. from one sugg.dens. to an other.
%But the rate of convergence can differ widely.

The transition kernel suggested by Markov ... in his original article ... corresponds to a suggestion density $g(\vec r_n|\vec r_{n+1})$ 
that is symmetric around $\vec r_n$ along all axis. In this case $\gamma(\vec r_n|\vec r_{n+1})$ can be expressed as
\begin{align} 
	\gamma(\vec r_A|\vec r_B)=max\left(
	\frac
	{P_w(\vec r_B)}
    {P_w(\vec r_A)}\, 
	,\, 1 \right) \label{gamma_bruteforce}
\end{align}
A common choice is to set
\begin{align}
	g(\vec r_n|\vec r_{n+1}) = \sum_i l\left(\mathcal U(\vec r_{n+1}-\vec r_n) - \frac12\right)
\end{align}
where $l$ is a constant which we will refer to as the steplength, and $\mathcal U(\vec r)$ is the uniform distribution
\begin{equation}
	\mathcal U(\vec r) = \left\{ 
	\begin{split} 
		&1, \text{ for all } \vec r \cdot \vec e_i \in [0,1]\\
		&0, \text{ otherwise }\\
	\end{split}
	\right..
\end{equation} 
Here $\vec e_i$ is the unit vectors of $\mathcal D$. 
By choosing testing different steplengths $l$ will alter the number of 
accepted steps during a simulation, and will have an effect on the rate of convergence. %For example, if nearly all steps are accepted, 
The class of sampling algorithms using a symmetric suggestion density is often referred to as brute force sampling.

An other class of sampling algorithms is based on the ..., where the random walkers ... the Langevin equation for

\section{Statistical analysis of the data}%{{{1

The statistical error.

%In our simulations, we will sample each point on the track of one single walker. 
%This is possible as long as the system is ergodetic. 
%That is, all $\vec r_n$ in $\mathcal D$ must be axessible to a 
%random walker starting in any point $\vec r_0$ in $\mathcal D$. 
%Otherwise, some parts of the integration domain would not be sampled.
The correlation between ,,
After a certain number of moves, the statistical correlation between
the starting point $\vec r_0$ and the current position $\vec r_n$ will be very weak (there will be no). 
((reference, weaker statement))
If we denote the correlation time $\tau$ and $N$ is the total number of MCMC cycles, 
we will have $\tau/N$ uncorrelates samples.

\section{Quantum monte Carlo}%{{{1 

\subsection{Introduction}%{{{2

%In the Heisenberg image, t
The expectation values for any observable $\hat O(t)$ can be expressed on the general form
\begin{align}
	\expec{ O(t) } = \int d\vec r \Psi(\vec r) \hat O(t) \Psi(\vec r)^*,\label{exv}
\end{align}
where $\Psi(\vec r) = \sum_i \psi_i(\vec r)$, for some basis $\{ \vec \psi_i \}$. 
The integral can also be written 
\begin{align}
	\expec{ O(t) } = \int |\Psi(\vec r)|^2 \frac{ \hat O(t) \Psi(\vec r)^\dagger } {\Psi(\vec r)^\dagger},
\end{align}
Since $|\Psi(\vec r)|^2$ is a probability density distribution we see that
\begin{align}
	\expec{ O(t) } \approx \sum_{i=1}^N \frac{ \hat O(t) \Psi(\vec r_i)^\dagger } {\Psi(\vec r_i)^\dagger}, \label{RFQMC1} 
\end{align}
%
where the set of numbers $\{\vec r_i\}$ are drawn from $|\Psi|^2$.
This sum can be sampled using the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm with the acceptance probability 
\begin{align}
	\gamma(r_i|r_i+1)=\frac
		{g(r_i|r_{i+1})\Psi(r_i)|^2}
		{g(r_{i+1}|r_i)|\Psi(r_{i+1})|^2}.
\end{align} 
$g(r_i|r_{i+1})$ is the suggestion density as desctibed earlier.
%
Note that $\Psi$ do not need to ne normalized in the above equations. This saves us a great deal of work since the normalization 
of most wavefunctions would have to be done numerically for every new trial function.% ????

\subsection{Variational Monte Carlo}%{{{2

Variational Monte Carlo (VMC) is used to calculate the lowest energy state $\epsilon_0$ in a quantum mechanical system.
According to the ritz principle, the expectationvalue for the energy 
\begin{align}
	\epsilon_0\ge\bra{\Psi_T} \hat H \ket{\Psi_T}\,\forall\,\ket{\Psi_T}\in\mathcal H.
\end{align} 
%And if $\bra\Psi\hat H \ket\Psi = \epsilon_0$ then $\ket\Psi=\ket{\phi_0}$ where $\ket{\phi_0}$ is the ground state of the hamiltonian. 
%
This means that any expectation value $\expec{\hat H}$ sets an upper limit to the energy of the system. 
%
This principle allows us to perform a systematic search for the lowest $\expec{\hat H}$ using a set of trial wave function 
$\ket{\Psi_T,\alpha,\beta,\dots}$ where $\alpha,\beta,\dots$ are variational parameters. % that changes the shape of the wave functions.

The search in the parameterspace $(\alpha,\beta, \dots)$ can be done by performing MCMC calculations on a grid. 
More sophisticated methods are also in use, like the conjugate gradient approach which will be described later in this text.

Since the variance $\expec{\hat H^2}-\expec{\hat H}^2=0$ for the eigenfunctions of $\hat H$, the variance is a measure of how close 
$\ket{\Psi_T,\alpha,\beta,\dots}$ is to the 'true' ground state wave function of the system. Even is the lowest energy obtained in our simulations will be closest 
to the ground state energy, the trial function with the lowest variance migt be a better fit to the 'true' groundstate wave function.
%}}}2

\subsection{The trial wave functions}%{{{2

Our system is a closed shell model with a hamiltonian 
\begin{align} 
	\hat H = -\frac{\nabla ^2}2 + \omega |\vec R|^2 - \sum_{i<j}\frac1{r_{ij}} 
\end{align}

Our trial wave function can be written on the form
\begin{align}
	\Psi_T(\vec r) = \Psi_\downarrow^{\alpha}(\vec r) \Psi_\uparrow^\alpha(\vec r) \mathcal J^\beta(\vec r) 
\end{align}
Here $\Psi_\uparrow(\vec r)$is a slater determinant consisting of the one particle soultions of the stationary schrÃ¶dinger equation
\begin{align}
	\phi_{n_xn_y}^\alpha(\vec r_i) = H_{n_y}(\sqrt{\omega\alpha}y)H_{n_x}(\sqrt{\omega\alpha}x)\notag\\
	\times \exp(-\frac12\omega\alpha|\vec r_i|^2) 
\end{align}
and $\vec r = (\vec r_0, \vec r_1,\dots,\vec r_n)$ is a vector containing the position of all electrons in the system.
The energy level $n=n_x+n_y$ will be $n+1$ times degenerated. ...


$\Psi_\downarrow^\beta(\vec r)$ is the corresponding determinant for the spin down states.
